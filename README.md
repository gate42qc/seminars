| 32. Combining dynamical decoupling and other Error mitigation techniques to improve reliability of  quantum computers |[arXiv:0911.3202](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3202.pdf)|DD-protected quantum gates outperform unprotected gates. Under suitable conditions, fault-tolerant quantum circuits constructed from DD-protected gates can tolerate stronger noise, and have a lower overhead cost, than fault-tolerant circuits constructed from unprotected gates.                                                                                                                                                                  | Arshak Hovhannisyan |
| 31. Boson sampling and possible applications to percolation theory|                          |  The original boson sampling, as well as gaussian boson sampling protocols is introduced.
